# Electron GN Scripts

This repository contains some helper/wrapper scripts to make working with GN easier, especially on Windows.

## Installation

### macOS / Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarshallOfSound/electron-gn-scripts.git
cd electron-gn-scripts
yarn
# You could also use `npm install` here
# You should probably add this to your path in your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/nix"
```

### Windows

```batch
git clone https://github.com/MarshallOfSound/electron-gn-scripts.git
cd electron-gn-scripts
set PATH="%PATH%;"
```

## Setup

This toolset does not yet have the ability to initialize an Electron GN setup from scratch so you'll have to
do the initial work.  These steps are outlined in the [GN Build Instructions](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/build-instructions-gn.md) and summarized below.

## Install Depot Tools

You'll need to install [`depot_tools`](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html#_setting_up)  to your system.

**On macOS:**

```sh
# Ensure you're in your home directory
cd ~
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
```

Add `depot_tools` to the end of your PATH (you will probably want to put this in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`).

**On Windows:**

1) Download the `depot_tools` [bundle](https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra/depot_tools.zip) and extract it to `C:\workspace\depot_tools`
2) Add `depot_tools` to the start of your `PATH` (must be ahead of any installs of Python)
3) From a cmd.exe shell, run the command `gclient` (with **no** arguments)

## Initial Electron Setup

After you've set up `depot_tools`, you'll only need to use the `e` command to perform initial setup.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/developer/folder
# This will create a new "electron" folder in the current directory
# It will set up a new evm config
# Sync down all the required code and bootstrap the output directory
e fetch
```

Following this, you just have to use `e build` and friends to actually build your newly cloned Electron setup.

## Usage

The main command is just called `e`, all sub-commands are `git` sub-command style.  I.e. `e command ...args`

### `e sync`

**If you ran `e fetch`, you can skip this step.**

This command is the equivalent to `gclient sync`. Any addition args passed to this command are appended to the sync command.

Some possible extra arguments include:

* `--output-json` - Output a json document to this path containing summary information about the sync.
* `--no-history` - Reduces the size/time of the checkout at the cost of no history.
* `--ignore_locks` - Ignore cache locks.

Basic Usage:

```sh
e sync
```

Example Usage with extra arguments:

```sh
e sync --ignore_locks
```

### `e bootstrap`

**If you ran `e fetch`, you can skip this step.**

This command is the equivalent of `gn gen`: it generates required output directories and ninja configurations.

```sh
e bootstrap
```

### `e build`

This command runs `ninja` in your `out` directory.

It defaults to building Electron, but you can pass a single argument to this command to change what gets built.

* `electron`: Builds the Electron binary
* `electron:dist`: Builds the Electron binary and generates a dist zip file
* `mksnapshot`: Builds the `mksnapshot` binary
* `chromedriver`: Builds the `chromedriver` binary
* `node:headers`: Builds the node headers `.tar.gz` file
* `breakpad`: Builds the breakpad `dump_syms` binary

**You probably only want to run the default command with no apppended arguments**

Example Usage:

```sh
# Default - build Electron itself
e build
```

```sh
# Build the Electron binary and generates a dist zip file
e build electron:dist
```

```sh
# Build the mksnapshot binary
e build mksnapshot
```

```sh
# Build the chromedriver binary
e build chromedriver
```

```sh
# Build the node headers .tar.gz file
e build node:headers
```

```sh
# Build the breakpad `dump_syms` binary
e build breakpad
```

### `e start`

Starts the generated Electron binary, passes all extra arguments directly through to Electron.  E.g.

```bash
e start path/to/my/app

e start --version
```

### `e test`

This commands runs the Electron tests using the generated Electron binary. It passes all extra arguments directly to the spec runner.

Possible Extra Arguments:
* `--ci` - Runs Electron's tests in CI mode.
* `--runners=remote` - Only runs Electron's tests in the Renderer Process (found in the [`spec`](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/master/spec)).
* `--runners=main` - Only runs Electron's tests in the Main Process (found in the [`spec-main`](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/master/spec-main)).

Basic Usage:

```sh
e test
```

Example Extra Arguments:

```sh
# Run Main Process tests in CI mode 
e test --ci --runners=main
```

### `e debug`

Initializes [lldb](https://lldb.llvm.org/) (on macOS) or [gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) (on Linux) with the debug target set to your local Electron build.

```bash
e debug

# You should then see (on macOS, for example):
# (lldb) target create "/Users/codebytere/Developer/electron-gn/src/out/Testing/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron"
#Current executable set to '/Users/codebytere/Developer/electron-gn/src/out/Testing/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron' (x86_64).
# (lldb) < you can now run debug commands here>
```

Debugging Resources:
* `lldb` [Tutorial](https://lldb.llvm.org/use/tutorial.html)
* `gdb` [Tutorial](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~sugih/pointers/summary.html)

**Nota Bene:** This works on macOS and Linux only.

### `e export-patches [patch-dir]`

Exports patches to the desired patch folder in Electron source tree.

Valid patch directories include:
* `node`
* `v8`
* `boringssl`
* `chromium`

**Nota Bene:** You need to be running at least Bash v4 to use this command.

## Multiple Configs

If you're doing a lot of Electron development and constantly switching targets or branches it is a good idea to
have multiple configurations with different out directories or `buildType`'s.  You can easily switch between configs
using `evm`.

If you copy your `config.yml` and name the copy `config.debug.yml` you can switch to that config using

```bash
evm debug
e build
```

You can have as many config files as you want and switch to them at any time using `evm $CONFIG_NAME`.
